Flash card app uses pandas and tkinter, displays random word from wordlist on French and after 3 seconds translation in English. 
If user clicks "OK" - that means user knows translation of the word and removes it from word list, so in the future word w`ont be displayed.
Buy clicking "No" means the user doesn`t know translation, app opens new word, but previous one stays in wordlist.
